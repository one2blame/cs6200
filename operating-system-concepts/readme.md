# Operating System Concepts Notes

## Introduction

These are my notes for the textbook: _Operating System Concepts 10th edition_ by **Abraham Silberschatz et. al.**

These notes will be done by chapter and outline the basic conecpts I will be gleaning from each chapter. Expect to find definitions typed near the bottom of each Markdown file, and general concepts noted in the body.
